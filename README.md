# Why do we need Neural Networks?
Real life problems, are complex in nature and many times, it wont follow any algorithm. In such cases, we need a way that is capable of *learning* certain patterns without any human involvement or rule feeding. We need a model that is capable of:
- learning relationships between inputs and outputs that are nonlinear and complex
- make generalizations and inferences
- reveal hidden relationships, patterns and predictions
- model highly volatile data (such as financial time series data)


Areas where neural networks can be useful in better decision making:

- computer vision
- natural language processing
- financial predictions for stock prices, bond ratings etc
- robotic control system
